    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uhm I don‚Äôt really know how do I start telling facts and stuff about myself. 
	I find it very hard to describe myself in a positive light without sounding arrogant. I don‚Äôt know why is it so hard to do, but I can
	only either sound humble or cocky. I guess the best way for you to know more about me is to visit my blog often. Though to me there‚Äôs
	nobody that knows me better than myself and I‚Äôm always able and ready to describe myself whether it be my ‚Äúgood‚Äù qualities or my ‚Äúnot
	so good‚Äù qualities.(I guess haha) Nobody is perfect, and we have to find happiness within ourselves regardless of our personal qualities
	when it comes to ‚Äúwho‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äù we are.</p>
    <p>The nbsp can be used also regardless of how many &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spaces you want in the text.</p><br>

    <p><blockquote>I look out for the bad things, know there is bad that can happen to me, and expect bad things to happen to me. I do fear
	everyday that one great and terrible thing may happen.. This is when I feel paranoid, angry or otherwise negativly towards the world. But
	deep down, when the clouds of confusion are gone I realize that good can happen and has happened to me. My life is a wide road with obstacles,
	distractions and terrors but it also has friends, fun challenges and lessons. The way I see it, good and bad can and has happened. I just look
	out for both so I can never truly be surprised. :)</blockquote></p>
